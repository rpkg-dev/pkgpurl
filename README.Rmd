The basic idea behind the concept this package implements originates from Yihui Xie. See his blog post [_Write An R Package Using Literate Programming Techniques_](https://yihui.org/rlp/) for more details, it's definitively worth reading. This package's function `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` is just a less cumbersome alternative to the Makefile approach outlined by him.
