# TODOs

- [ ] Mention RStudio-Add-In [splitChunk](https://github.com/LudvigOlsen/splitChunk/) and file a bug report for native RStudio support for this functionality (the add-in has a few issues; e.g. splits in the wrong source pane when invoked from command palette and the active source pane is not primary one)

- [ ] Check out <https://rtask.thinkr.fr/when-development-starts-with-documentation/>

- [ ] Advertise package at relevant places
